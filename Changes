Darcs-Notify (2.0)

  * Darcs::Notify Darcs:Notify::Email: Split email routines into new
    subclass Darcs::Notify::Email. This should allow subclassing for
    different notification techniques.

  * Darcs::Notify: Changed calling convention so that the subclasses can
    work.

  * Added Darcs::Notify::Base for extending Darcs::Notify with new
    notifiers. This is better than the previous change and should allow
    for multiple notifiers at once.

  * Changed the calling conventions for Darcs::Notify->new() yet
    again. I'm way more happy about it this time, at least.

  * Released 2.0 (Seems crazy to release a major version 2 days later, but
    the API completely changed--apparently 1.0 was a little optimistic,
    numbering-wise).

Darcs-Notify (1.0)
